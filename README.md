Shakespeare Character-Level Text Generator

This project trains a character-level language model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate text in the style of Shakespeare.

The model learns the statistical patterns of characters in Shakespeareâ€™s plays and poems. After training, it can generate entirely new text that looks like Shakespeareâ€™s writing.

ðŸš€ How It Works

Input Data

The training dataset is Shakespeareâ€™s works.

Each character (letters, punctuation, spaces) is encoded into numbers.

Model Architecture

Embedding layer â†’ Converts characters into dense vectors.

LSTM layer â†’ Remembers the sequence of characters and learns long-term dependencies.

Dense + Softmax layer â†’ Predicts probabilities for the next character.

Text Generation

Start with a seed string (e.g., "To be or not to ").

The model predicts the next character.

That character is added to the input, and the process repeats.

This loop continues until the desired length of text is generated.

ðŸŽ› Important Parameters

Temperature â†’ Controls creativity in predictions:

Low (e.g., 0.2) â†’ more predictable, safer text.

High (e.g., 1.0) â†’ more random, creative text.

Length â†’ Number of characters to generate.

Sample â†’ The seed text that kicks off the generation.

âš¡ Usage
1. Train the Model
python train.py

2. Generate Text
python generate.py --seed "To be or not to " --length 500 --temperature 0.7

ðŸ“Š Example Output

With seed: "To be or not to "

To be or not to bide the fair winds of fate,  
And with a trembling hand doth write his soul.  
The moonlight weeps upon the silent stage,  
Where kings and clowns alike do play their part.  

ðŸ§  What the Model Actually Does

The model does not understand meaning like humans. Instead, it:

Learns statistical patterns in character sequences.

Predicts the most likely next character.

Repeats this prediction in a loop to create new text.

This is enough to generate convincing Shakespeare-like language.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Train on word-level tokens for better structure.

Use Transformer models for higher quality text.

Add an interactive web UI to generate text in real time.
